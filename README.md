# Team Management System (TMS)

## Introduction


This TMS was developed by Sarmad Hashmi, Salman Rana, Muraad Hared and Janac Meena. It allows instructors to sign up and create team parameters for their courses. In addition, it allows students to sign up and create teams, join teams and collaborate with members of their teams. 

## Development


The web server is written in Python with Flask. The UI or front-end is built in Android, which we learned from scratch for this project. We also make use of JSON Web Tokens for authorization.
